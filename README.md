# Koala Framework
One koala wants to build his own framework.

He's very lazy so he takes all the components from everywhere.

He thinks real OOP means no interdependency.

## Features
* Zero interdependency
* Elegant structure

## Design Principle
* Take the hands-on library if there's already one in the world!
* Implementing the functionality in static method if it's possible.
* Instantiating are usually unnecessary. Just make it static method.
* Static method can really finish most of the tasks. I'm serious.

## Components
* Router is Toro https://github.com/anandkunal/ToroPHP
* ORM is RedBean http://redbeanphp.com/manual3_0/welcome
* Some libraries are from Codeigniter https://github.com/EllisLab/CodeIgniter
